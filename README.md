Simple rust program that helps configure env variables

This repository is going to contain code of my first 48 hour rust adventure, because of holidays I've spent a lot of
time outdoors during this time though. Real time dedicated to this program is about 12 hours - counting from the first
minute of reading the documentation about hello world.

I know that the code is incredibly bad, but it was all about fun to me. I just wanted to play with the language and try
it out the best I could.

It showed me how amazing language rust is and it definitely won't be my last time coding in it.
